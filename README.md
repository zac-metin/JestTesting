# Testing Types

Unit testing: small module or function, testing a small part of your code.

Interaction testing: Confirm interactions work, Assert a function is called on click, message displays, no browser required (Enzyme)

Structural Testing: Validates HTML output. Takes a picture of components output, snapshot testing. Jest saves copy of output with given input, tests break when output changes.
